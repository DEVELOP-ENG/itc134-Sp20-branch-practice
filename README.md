 This is a repo we used to practice branching and merging

Jovanni Rodriguez looked at the magic map in his hands and felt happy.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his damp surroundings. He had always loved urban Madrid with its vivacious, villainous volcanoes. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel happy.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Noel Eng. Noel was a spiteful patient with ugly eyes and grubby ankles.

Jovanni gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a malicious, helpful, beer drinker with brown eyes and scrawny ankles. His friends saw him as a plain, putrid patient. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for an ashamed deaf person.

But not even a malicious person who had once made a cup of tea for an ashamed deaf person, was prepared for what Noel had in store today.

The clouds danced like laughing foxes, making Jovanni sleepy.

As Jovanni stepped outside and Noel came closer, he could see the dripping smile on his face.

"I am here because I want a wifi code," Noel bellowed, in a patient tone. He slammed his fist against Jovanni's chest, with the force of 6885 badgers. "I frigging love you, Jovanni Rodriguez."

Jovanni looked back, even more sleepy and still fingering the magic map. "Noel, I've got a new job," he replied.

They looked at each other with anxious feelings, like two grubby, gigantic goldfish walking at a very understanding rave, which had indie music playing in the background and two courageous uncles rampaging to the beat.

Jovanni regarded Noel's ugly eyes and grubby ankles. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently.

"Hmph," pondered Noel.

"Please?" begged Jovanni with puppy dog eyes.

Noel looked angry, his body blushing like a pickled, panicky piano.

Then Noel came inside for a nice drink of beer.
